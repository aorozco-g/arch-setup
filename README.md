# Arch set up script

This is my personal script to automate the configuration of a new installation of Arch if needed.
Will be adding more features and packages, as they come into my mind or I add things to my system.

# To Do

 1. Set up SDDM to use Wayland (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM#Wayland)
 2. Set up Firefox with Betterfox (https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox)
 3. Probably add Gamescope
 4. Try to automate the DNIe USB configuration in Firefox (https://minibots.wordpress.com/2023/03/24/uso-de-dnie-con-lector-de-tarjetas-usb-en-archlinux/ #Integration with Firefox)
 5. Add SaveDesktop to restore my dotfiles (or any other app/method maybe easier to add the dots to the repo itself)
 6. Add a step to download the XCompose from https://github.com/raelgc/win_us_intl to mirror Windowsâ„¢ US International layout
 7. Add ca_ES and en_GB as locale and generate it.
