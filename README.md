# Arch set up script

This is my personal script to automate the configuration of a new installation of Arch if needed.
Will be adding more features and packages, as they come into my mind or I add things to my system.

# To Do

 1. Set up SDDM to use Wayland
 2. Set up Firefox with Betterfox
 3. Probably add Gamescope
 4. Try to automate the DNIe USB configuration in Firefox
 5. Add SaveDesktop to restore my dotfiles (or any other app/method maybe easier to add the dots to the repo itself)
